# Etch-a-sketch
Etch a sketch DOM Manipulation application. Goal is to be able to pain using mouse over. 

31/08/2022 - Added the basic functionality to set grid size (restrictions apply, console.log message if too high/low number) and changing colour to purple on mouse over. 

03/09/2022 - Added color pick functionality, clear board functionality and made a basic design. What to modify later is adding a slider for the size, paint on mouse down and an eraser option.
